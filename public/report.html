                    <p>The Prisoner's Dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two
                        completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best
                        interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working
                        at
                        RAND in 1950. [Source: Wikipedia]</p>
                    <p>This survey was a modified simulation of the same. It is a part of my Philosophy Project at
                        college. This report shows the results and observations for the same.</p>
                    <p>This survey received around 148 responses in the first week of being live. A big thank you to all
                        the people who filled it up! :)</p>

                            <p>In this case, the penalties were set to resemble with original Prisoner's Dilemma (which
                                however assumes the other person to be intelligent only).</p>
                            <p>Though, we do see get to see rather mixed opinions with only a little
                                cooperation/betrayal margin, opposed to the original paradox, according to which number
                                of betrayals would be a lot more than number of cooperations.</p>
                            <p>The additional thing here is the assumption of the other person being unintelligent. We
                                can observe a deviation in the distribution in this case. People tend to Betray when
                                they assume that the other person is not intelligent.</p>
                            <p>Putting it differently, we may say that people do tend to cooperate if they assume that
                                the other person is intelligent, probably expecting for a similar action on the other
                                end.</p>

                                reduced by a great extent.</p>
                            <p>It is very evident from the responses that people prefer cooperating in this case. This
                                shows that people are willing to cooperate as the risk factor reduces. It is
                                also worth noting the order in which the cases are put up. That is, people tend to
                                cooperate in this case after they faced the original situation in which the
                                penalties were higher.</p>
                            <p>Also, it can be observed that the number of betrayals increases when the other person is
                                assumed to be unintelligent. <i>More on this in the last section.</i>

                            <p>In this case, mutual cooperation was favoured, by releasing all charges when both
                                cooperate. Also, in case of a conflict, where one betrays and the other cooperates, even
                                the one who betrays gets some punishment (in contrast to the original case where the
                                person who betrays is set free in such a situation).</p>
                            <p>A very good thing to note is that this simply works as expected :) There are very less
                                betrayals compared to cooperations.</p>
                            <p>Again, the ratio of number of betrayals to cooperations is higher in the case where the
                                other person is assumed to be unintelligent.</p>

                            <p>In this case, the punishment in cases of common respone (either both cooperate or both
                                betray) were kept ambiguous. This case was intentionally put up in the end, in an
                                attempt to build up a mindset that generally mutual cooperation leads to lesser
                                punishment. In case of a conflict (one cooperates and other betrays), the one who
                                cooperates suffers larger punishment.</p>
                            <p>The motive here was to see whether people cooperate based on an instinct built up from
                                the previous cases or they betray just seeing the lesser punishment (and assuming the
                                other would cooperate).</p>
                            <p>One interesting thing to note is that many people avoided this case since there were
                                considerably lesser (around 20 less) responses to this case when compared to other
                                cases.</p>
                            <p>For the responses received, we can observe that people tend to cooperate when the other
                                person is assumed to be intelligent. However, in the other situation, the difference
                                between number of cooperations and betrayals decreased.</p>
                            <p>That is, people tend to go with the instinct instead of the apparent benefit (which
                                however involves some amount of risk in case the other betrays).</p>

                    <p>This is a comparision for total number cooperations or betrayals when the other person is assumed
                        to be intelligent versus when the other person is assumed to be unintelligent, summed up over
                        all cases.</p>
                    <p>It can be easily observed that number of betrayals get increased by a lot when the other person
                        is assumed to be unintelligent.</p>
                    <p>This is an interesting point. Let's say we fix that person
                        A betrays. We have two cases. One, A thinks that the other unintelligent person (B) would
                        cooperate, since <i>B is not intelligent</i>, and hence A would betray for getting released.
                        Two, A thinks that B would betray. But in this case, A should prefer to cooperate in order to
                        get lesser penalty (unless A doesn't want a tit-for-tat). So, A won't betray.</p>
                    <p>Hence, people tend to betray more under the assumption that the other person is not intelligent,
                        thinking that the other person <i>would cooperate</i>.</p>
