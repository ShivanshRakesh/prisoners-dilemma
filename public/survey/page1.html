            <h3 class="heading">Hey! Welcome to the survey! So you will be given 4 situations based on a common
                scenario. For each situation, there will be 2 questions, which you need to answer.<br /><br />That's
                all!
                Simple, right?</h3>
            <br />
            <h1 class="question display-5">So let's get started!</h1>
        </div>

        <div id="prompt2" class="section mx-auto">
            <h1 class="question">Okay, so here is the base scenario.</h1>
            <div class="prompt">
                You and your friend are members of a criminal gang. You both are arrested and imprisoned. Both of you
                are in solitary confinement
                which means you can't talk to your friend. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict you both
                on the principal charge, but they hope to get both of you sentenced to a year in prison on a lesser
                charge.
                The prosecutors offer you a bargain. Both of you are given two options:
                <br /><br />
                Either <span style="color:#f8b467">betray</span> the other by testifying that the other committed the crime.
                <br /><br />
                Or <span style="color:#f8b467">cooperate</span> with the other by remaining silent.
                <br />
                <br />
                Note that you won't know what your friend will be choosing since you both can't talk.
                <br />
                <br />
