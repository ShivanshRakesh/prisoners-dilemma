            <h3 class="heading">Hey! Welcome to the survey! So you will be given 4 situations based on a common
                scenario. For each situation, there will be 2 questions, which you need to answer.<br /><br />That's
                all!
                Simple, right?</h3>
            <br />
            <h1 class="question display-5">So let's get started!</h1>
        </div>

        <div id="prompt2" class="section mx-auto">
            <h1 class="question">Okay, so here is the base scenario.</h1>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p>
                    You are member of a criminal gang. You and an other person from the gang are arrested as suspects for a crime. Both of
                    you are in solitary confinement which means you can't talk to each other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict
                    on the principal charge, but they hope to get both of you sentenced to a year in prison on a lesser
                    charge.
                    The prosecutors offer you two a bargain, which will be described later. Both of you have 2 options for each such offer:
                </p>
                <p>Either <span style="color:#f8b467">betray</span> the other by testifying that the other committed the
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Or <span style="color:#f8b467">cooperate</span> with the other by remaining silent.</p>
                <p>Note that you won't know what the other will be choosing since you both can't talk.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />

            <h1 class="question">Situation ONE.</h1>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p>
                    ThisIf A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison
If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa)
If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge)
                </p>
                <p>Either <span style="color:#f8b467">betray</span> the other by testifying that the other committed the
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Or <span style="color:#f8b467">cooperate</span> with the other by remaining silent.</p>
                <p>Note that you won't know what your friend will be choosing since you both can't talk.</p>
